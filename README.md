Stock Price Prediction Using Python & Machine Learning.
In this project artificial recurrent neural network called Long short term memory in order to predict the closing stock price of a corporation using the past 60 days data.

# Data set
Pandas datareader function was used to retrive data from yahoo API for stock price data.

# Result

RMSE was used to get the final value of price.

# Model

Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feed forward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. It can not only process single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video).

LSTMs are widely used for sequence prediction problems and have proven to be extremely effective.The reason they work so well is because LSTM is able to store past information that is important, and forget the information that is not.
